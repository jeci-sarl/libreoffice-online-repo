This is an Alfresco Repository AMP module that adds WOPI host capabilities to Alfresco.<br/>
It does not implement the full WOPI protocol, merely the following endpoint interfaces:
- [ ] CheckFileInfo
- [ ] GetFile and
- [ ] PutFile

This module was developed against Alfresco version 5.1.g.

### Webapplication Open Platform Interface protocols

For information on WOPI, see http://wopi.readthedocs.io/projects/wopirest/en/latest/endpoints.html for the list of WOPI endpoints.

First install LibreOfficeOnLine.

See http://docs.alfresco.com/5.0/tasks/dev-extensions-tutorials-simple-module-install-amp.html for how to install this module in your Alfresco repository installation.

Add the following properties to your alfresco-global.properties file:

- [ ] lool.wopi.url=https://lool.server.domain:[port-number]
- [ ] lool.wopi.url.discovery=https://host.domain/path-to-discovery.xml
- [ ] lool.wopi.alfresco.host=https://alfresco.proxy-url-host.domain (Not important but used to get around proxy issues for now)

### JDK 8+
